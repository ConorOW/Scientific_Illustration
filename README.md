The Matplotlib Raincloud Plots.ipynb notebook shows some of the visualization methods we can use to display how the same variables appear at different sites in large international studies.

The Multisite DTI harmonization.ipynb shows a method, ComBat-GAM harmonization, and how it can be used to correct for some of the site-effects that exist in large multi-site studies. ComBat-GAM is able to reduce some of the variance in data that might be associated with factors we are not interested in, while at the same time retaining biological variance of interest.

The midAxes_extraction.py script is a tool that we can use to extract 2D niftis or 2D pngs from a 3D brain image, by finding the mid-point along each axis. This can be useful for machine learning tasks where we require a 2D image for some process.

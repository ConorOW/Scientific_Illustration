The `Matplotlib Raincloud Plots.ipynb` notebook shows some of the visualization methods we can use to display how the same variables appear at different sites in large international studies.

The `Multisite DTI harmonization.ipynb` shows a method, ComBat-GAM harmonization, and how it can be used to correct for some of the site-effects that exist in large multi-site studies. ComBat-GAM is able to reduce some of the variance in data that might be associated with factors we are not interested in, while at the same time retaining biological variance of interest.
